## Synopsis

This report surveys the impacts of major storms and weather events in the United States from 1996 through 2011. Our goal was to identify the storm/weather types that were most harmful to human health, as well as those types that had the greatest economic consequences. To perform this analysis, we obtained a version of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA’s) storm database. We focused on the period from 1996 through 2011, when the data set was more reliable and complete. Analysis determined the top 10 event types for harm to human health. For example, the top 3 of these event types were tornadoes, heat, and floods. Analysis also determined the top 10 event types for damage to property and crops. For example, the top 3 of these event types were floods, hurricanes, and storm surges.
